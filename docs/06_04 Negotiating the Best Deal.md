Negotiating should be part of every job application. In this video, we'll talk about how to negotiate a good deal and when you should start talking about compensation in the job process.

If you've been made a written offer, you've reached the pinnacle of the job process. An offer means that they want to hire you! Not the other people they're interviewing, but you personally. You are their number one choice. At this point in their mind they've bought the car. They can picture you working there being productive and helpful to the company.

I'm assuming that at this point in the conversation, they talked about salary and asked you how much do you want to make. If they say that they're ready to make you an offer, then simply ask them what their offer is.

It's important to think of compensation as not just your salary but the entire package. What is the base salary, what about equity, stock options, how much would you be paying for insurance? How many vacation days do you get? What are other perks. All of these things have real value and are calculations that make comparing jobs difficult. Also, make sure you ask how often they give raises, etc. Your job is to gather information at this point, write down some notes. Once you receive that information, ask for it in writing.

## The Offer Letter

Real professionals ask for offer letters. Also, great companies write their offers down to make sure things are clear between the two parties. At this point you should ask for a couple of days to think it over. If you're really excited and you know the offer is good, then feel free to accept it, but it's sometimes better to extract yourself from the excitement and take the time to go through their numbers carefully. Sometimes their salary will be great, but you pay so much more for insurance that it won't be a good deal.

Now it's time for you to make a decision about the company you interviewed with. I did mention that interviewing is a two way process. With an offer letter, the tables turn and you should examine everything you learned about the company and ask yourself if this is the best place for you to be. Do they have your interests in mind. Are they dedicated to helping you grow. How often do they review your compensation. What is the team you're working with like?

You may be having second thoughts about leaving your current job. Maybe the company that you're working for is really great, but the fact that you're not getting to your earning potential is what is really bothering you. You can choose to negotiate with your current company at this point. If you have feelings like this, make an appointment with your manager and tell them how you feel. They may be willing to make you a counter offer. They may be willing to give you a promotion. Staying where you are is fine and sometimes the best option. If you are working in a great place that cares about you and gives you opportunity for growth, that's sometimes worth as much as monetary compensation.

## Doing it...or not

After you've talked it over with your family (it might involve some disruption like moving somewhere else or adjusting schedules) and took at deep look at the offer, it's time to accept it. Make sure you save that offer letter, and get ready to continue your career.

If there are specific issues with compensation you can talk to them about them and negotiate what they're offering. Everything is on the table at this point. This is when it's important to keep those numbers you thought of before. There is an optimal amount you want to make and a 'walk away' amount you should have in your head. You can negotiate things other than salary. Are they willing to give you an extra week of vacation (since that's what you were getting at the other company). There are things that the company can adjust. For example, if your company pays a bigger percentage of the insurance, they can adjust your salary to compensate.

If they are not willing or able to get to a reasonable agreement, then it's time to walk away. Observing how a company negotiates is a good way to gauge how they are going to treat you as a profesional. It's also a good way to demonstrate how you're going to act as an employee.

It's ok to turn the offer down if it's not the right offer. This is tough for both of you since you've placed a lot into this. It's really important that you're willing to walk away. Be polite, just say something like this.

"I'm not sure this is the right offer for me, thank you for your time, I really hope you can find the right person to fill this position."

Sometimes they'll make you their best offer after this, sometimes they won't be able to. In your heart though when you walk away, make sure you're are not just doing it because you want more money, make sure you're doing it because it isn't a good deal.
